              Formal definition of ML by Mitchell (1997): A computer program is
              said to learn from experience <strong>E</strong> with respect to
              some class of tasks <strong>T</strong> and performance measure
              <strong>P</strong>, if its performance at tasks in
              <strong>T</strong>, as measured by <strong>P</strong>, improves
              with experience <strong>E</strong>.

              Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and
              statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific
              task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and
              inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial
              intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical
              model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to
              make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed
              to perform the task.

              Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the
              relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and
              one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). The
              case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear
              regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is
              called multiple linear regression. This term is distinct from
              multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated
              dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar
              variable.

            <p>
              In linear regression, the relationships are modeled using linear
              predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated
              from the data.

              the logistic model (or logit model) is used to model the
              probability of a certain class or event existing such as
              pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick. This can be
              extended to model several classes of events such as determining
              whether an image contains a cat, dog, lion, etc. Each object being
              detected in the image would be assigned a probability between 0
              and 1 and the sum adding to one.

            <p>
              Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form
              uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable,
              although many more complex extensions exist. In regression
              analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating
              the parameters of a logistic model (a form of binary regression).
